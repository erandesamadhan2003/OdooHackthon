# ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

## 🌱 Overview

ReWear is a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. Our mission is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The fashion industry generates massive textile waste, with millions of tons of clothing ending up in landfills each year. ReWear addresses this by creating a community-driven platform where users can give their clothes a second life through sustainable trading and swapping.
